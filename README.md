# Talent Calculator for Icarus

A talent building tool and effect calculator for [RocketWerkz](https://rocketwerkz.com/)'s Icarus

This is intended as a replacement for [therealfaux](http://reddit.com/u/therealfaux)'s [Icarus Talent Tool](https://icarusbuilds.app/), which has not been updated in several years.

## Intended Use

I designed this tool to make theorycrafting and sharing talent builds for Icarus easier.
* Instead of having to spend gobs of Ren only to discover that you don't have enough points to get all the talents you want, why not be able to see that in a painless way?
* Instead of nebulous tooltips, why not show the exact effect of your talents?
