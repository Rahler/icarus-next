The costs for this were astronomical, and the program was quickly scrapped.",
    "Bee-Lore1": "The Bees of Icarus are known for their long, needle-like stingers which are capable of piercing even the toughest of envirosuits. Proceed with caution. Despite the danger, they are still a reasonable source of food for many contractors living long-term on-planet.",

    "MiniHippo-Lore1": "The result of another of Dr Lee's unsanctioned experiments, the Dribbo as it's been named by prospectors has become somewhat of an example of when science goes too far. Illegal genetic splicing of Earth hippo DNA and Icarus native DNA resulted in these curious-looking creatures. Once released planetside they were quick to reproduce, but the influence of Exotics quickly mutated some offspring.",
    "Scorpion_Boss-Lore1": "The result of engineered scorpions being accidentally released on Icarus. It's likely exposure to environmental conditions in addition to exotic material that caused extreme genetic mutation.",
